## Setup for each App

### Installation

To install each webapp follow the information in the readme [found here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-webapps/#installation).

#### App configuration

After the apps have been installed, each one has it's own configuration file that can be used to customize how the app behaves.

##### Boolean Search

There currently isn't any customization available for the boolean search app.

##### Heatmap

For customization, a file named `heatmap-config.js` should be included in the "/heatmap" folder on the server. More information about customization with an example can be [found here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-webapps/tree/master/heatmap#configuration).

##### Lineplot

For customization, a file named `lineplot-config.js` should be included in the "/lineplot" folder on the server. Customization for lineplot is very limited. An example can be [found here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-webapps/blob/master/lineplot/lineplot-config-sample.js).

##### Plot

Plot allows for many different plot types with differing configuration options. For customization, a file named `plot-config.js`should be included in the "/plot" folder on the server. More information about customization with an example can be [found here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-webapps/tree/master/plot#configuration).

##### Treeview

For customization, a file named `treeview-config.js` should be included in the "/treeview" folder on the server. More information about customization with an example can be [found here](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-webapps/tree/master/treeview#treeview).
